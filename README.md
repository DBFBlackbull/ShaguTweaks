# ShaguTweaks

<img src="_img/menu.jpg" float="right" align="right">

**A Small World of Warcraft AddOn for all those who don't want to make use of AddOns at all.**

The goal of ShaguTweaks is to be as non-intrusive to the default appearance as possible,
but also giving the user the choice to change additional things if desired.

The pre selected defaults of ShaguTweaks only add quality of life changes to the game, while preserving the look and feel of the original interface. It's up to everyones own preferences to enable more or even disable defaults.

All tweaks are made to the default interface and might not take effect if you already replaced some of the elements with other addons.

The addon settings can be controlled ingame via the "Advanced Options" button on the Main Menu (Esc).
Every of the listed features below can be completely disabled in that menu in case you don't like it.
